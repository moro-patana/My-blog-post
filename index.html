                My name is Manjaka. I am 22 years old. This is my first blog so I will tell more about myself.
                I am from in a small village called "Antokazo". It is in Ambatondrazaka district. I have three siblings; two sisters and one brother. I am the first child of our parents. My younger sister's name is Fleriah. she is 16 years old and my brother's name is Mahery. He is 8 years old. Our little sister and I have the same birthdate. she is 2 years old and her name is Fanamby.
                 We live with our grandma because our grandpa died in 2015. Our livelihood is agriculture. We plant rice, beans, and vegetables.
